# How to build this Android Studio project?
Checkout this project. Then use checkout its submodule.
Using CLI or GUI tools to invoke commands like:

`git.exe submodule update --init -- "Module/IMKBaseFrameworkLibrary"` and so on.

I recommended you to use TortoiseGit on Windows 10, so it's easy and fast.

After checking out all, just open the project. We're ready to program.

# How to config before running?
See the Sample module `IMKBaseFrameworkDemo`. Base classes are placed in package  `IMKBaseFrameworkDemo\src\main\java\com\soft2t\imk2tbaseframework\demo\base`.
