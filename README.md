# How to build this Android Studio project?
Checkout this project. Then use checkout its submodule.  
Using CLI or GUI tools to invoke commands like:  
  
`git.exe submodule update --init -- "Module/AndroidUniversalImageLoaderLibrary"`  
`git.exe submodule update --init -- "Module/xUtils2LibraryForAndroidStudio"`  
`git.exe submodule update --init -- "Module/IMKBaseFrameworkLibrary"`  
`git.exe submodule update --init -- "Module/IMKBaseFrameworkDemo"`  
  
I recommended you to use TortoiseGit on Windows 10, so it's easy and fast.

After checking out all, just open the project. We're ready to program.

# How to config before running?
See the Sample module [`IMKBaseFrameworkDemo`][1].  
Base classes are placed in package: [`IMKBaseFrameworkDemo\src\main\java\com\soft2t\imk2tbaseframework\demo\base`][2].
